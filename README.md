# homework_2

For this homework, my job was to create 3 different webpages and make them accomodate for different screen sizes. I used bootstrap components and elements to structure my code and make it responsive to resizing. For the portfolio page, I made it so that when resized to a smaller screen, it pushes each element into its own column.
